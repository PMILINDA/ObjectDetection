Abstract
Some portion of what makes getting in shape so troublesome is that checking calories is a vague science at best. Eating food without knowledge of its composition and nutritional contents prompts poor processing leading to poor health.  Each time you convey nourishment from the device it indeed, even with nutritious data, one needs to screen serving sizes, people are continually searching for approaches to enhance their health and wellbeing. The typical procedure of getting nutritional data is by utilizing google or utilizing some applications. In this paper, we have proposed a system which is portable, handy, needs less space and power, fast, is more proficient and simple. The Smart Refrigerator system is able to remotely alert the user about the scarce contents, expiry date and nutritional values. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the coordination of devices and systems that interconnect real world sensors and actuators to the Internet. This paper presents the abstraction, architecture, interfacing and functionality of such a device that incorporates the systems stated above: a system that interacts with objects of concern, gathers information about them, process this information into relevant data with the help of a dataset that is later conveyed to the user via an IOT platform.

Keywords- Internet of Things(IOT), Raspberry Pi 3b, Load cell sensor, Pi Camera, Machine Learning.
